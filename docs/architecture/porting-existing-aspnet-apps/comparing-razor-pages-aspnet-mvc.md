# Comparing Razor Pages to ASP.NET MVC

Razor Pages is the preferred way to create page- or form-based apps in ASP.NET Core. From the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/razor-pages/), "Razor Pages can make coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive than using controllers and views."
