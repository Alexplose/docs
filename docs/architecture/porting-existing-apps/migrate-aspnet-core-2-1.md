# Migrating to ASP.NET Core 2.1

ASP.NET Core 2.1 is an interesting release because it is the most recent .NET Core release to support both netcore and netframework runtimes. As such, it may offer an easier upgrade path for some applications when compared to upgrading all parts of the app to .NET Core at once.

## Should applications run on .NET Framework with ASP.NET Core 2.1?

Versions of .NET Core through 2.1 supported both .NET Core and .NET Framework runtimes. Does it make sense to migrate some or all of an application to ASP.NET Core 2.1 as a stepping stone, before porting over completely to .NET Core?
